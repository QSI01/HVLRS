1.   How to set appropriate mtd partition and address for reading/writing 
     factory data when using SPI board?

Ans. The kernel will recognize a command line argument "mtdparts" and create
     MTD partitions according to it.

     The argument "mtdparts" is currently defined in the command line argument
     "kernelargs" by default. The default value of "kernelargs" for SPI board
     is shown as follows:
     "kernelargs=mtdparts=RtkSFC:1024k(U-Boot)ro,64k(FWtbl)ro,128k(Factory),10944k(FW)ro,4096k(Free),128k(oops) init=/etc/init root=/dev/sda1 rootfstype=ext4 rootwait loglevel=8"

     The passed argument shows that the partition for storing factory data
     is defined at "/dev/mtd2" (The third mtd partition).

     To set the position where the factory tool read/write, two variables
     should be modified:
       Variable Name                Source
     * MTD_CHAR_DEV_PATH            rtk_mtd.c
     * FACTORY_START_ADDR           rtk_layout.h
     
     MTD_CHAR_DEV_PATH stores all posible device paths that may contain factory
     data. Set the appropriate mtd char device paths in this array. Notes that
     the program will use the first path that can be opened for R/W (order matters).

     FACTORY_START_ADDR indicates the address where the factory data stored.

2.   How to use the Makefile?

Ans. If this factory tool is installedd independently (i.e. not installed as
     OpenWRT package), following variables in the Makefile should be set.
       Variable Name
     * STAGING_DIR
     * TOOLCHAIN_PATH
     * CROSS_COMPILER
     * STORAGE_TYPE
     * CHIP_TYPE_NAME
    
    TOOLCHAIN_PATH should be set to the path of cross compiler.
    
    STORAGE_TYPE and CHIP_TYPE_NAME should be adjusted according to board type.
    The available options for these two variables are listed below.
      Variable Name                 Options
    * STORAGE_TYPE                  STOR_TYPE_SPI
                                    STOR_TYPE_EMMC

    * CHIP_TYPE_NAME                CHIP_TYPE_THOR
                                    CHIP_TYPE_KYLIN
