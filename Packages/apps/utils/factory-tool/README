1.   How to configure MTD partition and address for factory-tool
     when using SPI board?

Ans. The kernel will recognize a command line argument "mtdparts" and create
     MTD partitions according to it.

     The argument "mtdparts" is currently defined in the command line argument
     "kernelargs" by default. The default value of "kernelargs" for SPI board
     is shown as follows:
     "kernelargs=mtdparts=RtkSFC:1024k(U-Boot)ro,64k(FWtbl)ro,128k(Factory),10944k(FW)ro,4096k(Free),128k(oops) rdinit=/etc/init init=/etc/init root=/dev/sda1 rootfstype=ext4 rootwait loglevel=8"

     The passed argument shows that the partition where the factory data are
     stored is "/dev/mtd2" (The third MTD partition).

     To set the device & offset where the factory-tool read/write, two variables
     should be modified:
       Variable Name                Source
     * MTD_CHAR_DEV_PATH            rtk_mtd.c
     * FACTORY_START_ADDR           rtk_layout.h

     MTD_CHAR_DEV_PATH stores all posible device paths that may contain factory
     data. Set the appropriate MTD char device paths in this array. Notes that
     the tool will use the first path that can be opened for R/W (order matters).

     FACTORY_START_ADDR indicates the offset where the factory data are stored.

2.   How to use stand-alone factory-tool?

Ans. If factory-tool is installed independently (i.e. not installed as
     an OpenWRT package), following variables in the Makefile should be set.
       Variable Name
     * STAGING_DIR
     * TOOLCHAIN_PATH
     * CROSS_COMPILER
     * STORAGE_TYPE
     * CHIP_TYPE_NAME
    
    TOOLCHAIN_PATH is the cross compiler path.
    
    Please configure STORAGE_TYPE and CHIP_TYPE_NAME to the target board.
    Available options for these two variables are listed below.
      Variable Name                 Options
    * STORAGE_TYPE                  STOR_TYPE_SPI
                                    STOR_TYPE_EMMC
                                    STOR_TYPE_NAND

    * CHIP_TYPE_NAME                CHIP_TYPE_THOR
                                    CHIP_TYPE_KYLIN

    If the storage type of the target board is NAND flash, please add nandwrite
    & flash_erase to system path. Further information can be found in
    Package_nand-utils (OpenWRT package) or website of mtd-utils.
