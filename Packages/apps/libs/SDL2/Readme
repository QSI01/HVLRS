on Linux an EGL implementation could support X11, Wayland, 
GBM (Generic Buffer Manager),Surface Flinger, and perhaps other platforms
The patch of libSDL2 uses egl new functions that enable an EGL client to specify to which
platform a native resource belongs when creating an EGL resource from that native resource

To enable new functions, add CFLAGS=-DREALTEK_PATCH in your Makefile
